# HACKING

Some quick documentation for hackery of pump.io.

## JAVASCRIPT

* [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) should run without errors.
* [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js) is about right, with below exceptions.
* 4-character indent, spaces only (no tabs).
* double-quotes for strings.
* No internal space for parentheses; so "if (foo)", not "if ( foo )".
* Use [Step](https://github.com/creationix/step).
* Use [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/).
* Use [databank](https://github.com/evanp/databank). Don't write to some storage engine's API.
* Use [vows](http://vowsjs.org/).

## GENERAL

* Write tests first. Or, at least, soon after.
* Use github issues to track issues.
* Use Markdown for documentation.

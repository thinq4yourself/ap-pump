If you are making pull requests or contributing code, please take a
few seconds to electronically
[sign the Contributor License Agreement](http://www.clahub.com/agreements/e14n/pump.io).

This brief agreement just makes sure you know that the code is under
Apache 2.0, that you can only contribute stuff that you have rights
to, and that you need to talk to your employer if you have an IP
agreement with them.

It can also be helpful if you're adding issues, but isn't quite as big a deal.
